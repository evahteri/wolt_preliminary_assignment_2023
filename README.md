# My Solution for Preliminary Assignment for Engineering Positions Summer 2023

I chose to implement the backend version.

## Instructions

### Install and Launch

To launch the API locally you need to run these commands:

In the root directory:

- ```python3 -m venv venv``` to prepare virtual environment

- ```source venv/bin/activate``` to activate virtual environment

- ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` to install dependencies

- ```cd src/ ``` to go to the src folder

- ``` flask run ``` to launch the API on http://localhost:5000/

### Using the API

Test the application with a POST request with, for example, Postman's desktop application.

All requests should be directed to "http://localhost:5000/" as that is the only endpoint.
